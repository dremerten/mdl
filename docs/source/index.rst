Welcome to infoset-ng's documentation!
======================================

``infoset-ng`` is a lightweight Python 3 based REST API that stores
and/or retrieves timestamped data. It runs on Linux.

We recommend that you read as much as you can on installation, configuration, operation and the API to get a good understanding of the software.

The introduction will provide useful background information too.
